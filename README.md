# CMS_Reports

# 📋 Project Overview
Upgraded the in-built CMS reporting module by introducing four strategic reports tailored to different user roles—Agent Status, Content Status, Editor, and Account Executive Reports. These enhancements automated manual reporting, provided real-time insights, and saved ~100 hours annually across content and client-facing teams.

# 🔍 Business Problem
The content team relied heavily on manual data compilation to track content writing, approvals, and publishing status. This caused inefficiencies, inconsistencies, and a lack of real-time visibility into agent-specific and writer-specific progress.

# 💡 Solution Summary
Designed and implemented a robust reporting system within the CMS to address the tracking and visibility gap for content operations. Each report was customized to meet the unique needs of content creators (SMCs), Editors, and Account Executives (AEs), reducing time spent on reporting and improving transparency and accountability.
